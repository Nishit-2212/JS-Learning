Hi Team,
We’ll practice MongoDB on a large real-world dataset from GH Archive (public GitHub event data).
Your job:
Download a large dataset (hours/days)
Import it into MongoDB
Create indexes
Write queries (simple → complex) and measure performance using explain()
Dataset Source
Website: https://www.gharchive.org/
Hourly files are named: YYYY-MM-DD-HH.json.gz (time is UTC)
Example: https://data.gharchive.org/2026-02-16-15.json.gz
Prerequisites
You must have:
MongoDB running
mongosh
mongoimport (MongoDB Database Tools)
wget (or curl) and gunzip
Verify:
mongosh --version
mongoimport --version
wget --version (or curl --version)
gunzip --version
Step 1 — Download GH Archive data (choose ONE size)
Create a folder:
mkdir -p gharchive && cd gharchive
Option A (recommended): Download 1 full day (24 hours)
Replace the date with any date you want (UTC):
wget https://data.gharchive.org/2026-02-16-{0..23}.json.gz
Option B: Download 7 days (large)
Example: Feb 10–16 (UTC):
for d in 10 11 12 13 14 15 16; do
  wget https://data.gharchive.org/2026-02-$d-{0..23}.json.gz
done
Tips:
If a single hour fails, re-run wget for just that file.
Keep note of your date range and how many files you downloaded.
Step 2 — Import into MongoDB (streaming, fast)
We will import into:
DB: training
Collection: gh_events
Option 1: Fresh import (recommended — drop collection first)
Run from inside the gharchive/ folder:
gunzip -c *.json.gz | mongoimport \
  --db training --collection gh_events \
  --type json \
  --drop \
  --numInsertionWorkers 8
Option 2: Append import (do NOT drop)
gunzip -c *.json.gz | mongoimport \
  --db training --collection gh_events \
  --type json \
  --numInsertionWorkers 8
Step 3 — Verify import (must do)
In mongosh, check:
You can see the collection gh_events inside database training
The collection has a large number of documents (not 0)
Open 1–2 documents and understand the fields (look for: event type, repo name, actor, created time)
Step 4 — Indexing Tasks (no query answers)
You MUST create indexes to support common filters. Create:
An index that helps when filtering by event type
An index that helps when filtering by repo
An index that helps when filtering by actor
At least one compound index (example idea: combine a filter field + time field)
You must submit:
the index definitions you created
why you chose them (what query they help)
proof they exist (output of index list)
Practice Tasks (Simple → Complex) — clearer instructions
Important: Do not copy answers from others. You must write your own queries.
For each task, submit:
the query/pipeline you wrote
result summary (counts/top rows)
explain("executionStats") output when asked
Task 1 — “How many records do we have?”
Goal: Learn basic counting and filtering.
Do these:
Count all documents in gh_events
Count documents where type equals one specific event type (example: "PushEvent")
Count documents only within a time window (for example, one hour or one day from your imported range)
What to submit:
the 3 queries you wrote + their counts
Task 2 — “What are the top values?”
Goal: Learn grouping + sorting.
Do these (top 10 or top 20):
Top event types by number of events
Top repos by number of events
Top actors by number of events
What to submit:
3 aggregation pipelines + top results
Task 3 — “Do indexes really help?”
Goal: Learn performance testing with/without an index.
Steps:
Choose ONE query that filters by repo (or actor/type) and runs somewhat slow without indexes.
Run it with explain("executionStats") and record:
totalDocsExamined
totalKeysExamined
executionTimeMillis
whether it used an index (IXSCAN) or full scan (COLLSCAN)
Drop the relevant index (only the one related to that query).
Run the same query again with explain("executionStats")
Compare numbers (with index vs without index)
Re-create the index you dropped
What to submit:
query + the two explain outputs
Task 4 — “Hourly trend”
Goal: Learn time-bucketing using created_at.
Do:
Calculate event counts per hour (across your imported data)
Add a filter (example: only one event type) and run again
Compare performance using explain() on at least one of them
What to submit:
pipelines + 1 explain output
Task 5 — “Understand the data shape”
Goal: Learn schema exploration.
Do:
Identify which important fields are sometimes missing
Find how many unique repos and unique actors you have
Pick one nested field and show you can filter/group on it
What to submit:
queries/pipelines + short notes

Step 4 — Indexing Tasks (no query answers)
You MUST create indexes to support common filters.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. An index that helps when filtering by event type

- db.gh_events.createIndex({type:1})

Query :- db.gh_events.find({type:'PushEvent'}).explain('executionStats')
Before Indexing:-
                executionTimeMillis: 820481
After Indexing :- 
                executionTimeMillis: 410481



2. An index that helps when filtering by repo

- db.gh_events.createIndex({'repo.name':1})


Query :- db.gh_events.find({'repo.name': 'wikibook/sqld'}).explain('executionStats')
Before Indexing:-
                winningPlan: {
                    stage: 'COLLSCAN',
                    filter: { 'repo.name': { '$eq': 'wikibook/sqld' } },
                    direction: 'forward'
                },
                TotalDocsExamined: 48282086,
                executionTimeMillisEstimate: 237716,   isEqualto = 3.96 minutes
After Indexing:-
                winningPlan: {
                    stage: 'FETCH',
                    inputStage: {
                        stage: 'IXSCAN',
                        keyPattern: { 'repo.name': 1 },
                        indexName: 'repo.name_1',
                        isMultiKey: false,
                        multiKeyPaths: { 'repo.name': [] },
                        isUnique: false,
                        isSparse: false,
                        isPartial: false,
                        indexVersion: 2,
                        direction: 'forward',
                        indexBounds: {
                        'repo.name': [ '["Nishit-2212/JS-Learning", "Nishit-2212/JS-Learning"]' ]
                        }
                    }
                }
                executionTimeMillis: 2416,
                totalDocsExamined: 6,




3. An index that helps when filtering by actor



4. 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 1 — “How many records do we have?”
Goal: Learn basic counting and filtering.
Do these:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Count all documents in gh_events
Ans:- 
- db.gh_events.find().count()
          OR
- db.gh_events.countDocuments()
Output:-   48282086
* The only difference between them is speed. The execution time of countDocuments is >> .count()


2. Count documents where type equals one specific event type (example: "PushEvent")
Ans:-
- db.gh_events.aggregate([{$match:{type:'PushEvent'}},{$count:"Total_PushEvent"}])
Output:-[ { Total_PushEvent: 32158622 } ]


3. Count documents only within a time window (for example, one hour or one day from your imported range)
Ans:- 
- 




----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 2 — “What are the top values?”
Goal: Learn grouping + sorting.
Do these (top 10 or top 20):
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Top event types by number of events
- db.gh_events.aggregate([ { $group: { _id: '$type',Total:{$sum:1}}}, {$sort : {Total:-1}}])
Output:- 
[
  { _id: 'PushEvent', Total: 32158622 },
  { _id: 'CreateEvent', Total: 4141458 },
  { _id: 'PullRequestEvent', Total: 4019386 },
  { _id: 'DeleteEvent', Total: 1615216 },
  { _id: 'IssueCommentEvent', Total: 1574572 },
  { _id: 'IssuesEvent', Total: 1283596 },
  { _id: 'WatchEvent', Total: 1090960 },
  { _id: 'PullRequestReviewCommentEvent', Total: 889392 },
  { _id: 'PullRequestReviewEvent', Total: 805856 },
  { _id: 'ReleaseEvent', Total: 263488 },
  { _id: 'ForkEvent', Total: 245716 },
  { _id: 'MemberEvent', Total: 94570 },
  { _id: 'CommitCommentEvent', Total: 29298 },
  { _id: 'PublicEvent', Total: 29174 },
  { _id: 'GollumEvent', Total: 28800 },
  { _id: 'DiscussionEvent', Total: 11982 }
]


2. Top repos by number of events
- db.gh_events.aggregate([
... { $group : {_id:'repo.name',TotalEvents:{$sum:1} }},
... { $sort : {TotalEvents:-1}},
... { $project : { Repo_name:"$_id",NumberOfEvents:"$TotalEvents"} } ])
